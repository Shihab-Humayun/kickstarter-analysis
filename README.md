# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perform analysis on the Kickstarter data sheet to discover trends. Louiseâ€™s play, Fever, came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to learn how different campaigns progressed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. I referenced the Kickstarter dataset to create a visualization for these campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the analysis of outcomes based on launch date, I created a pivot table and a chart to visualize the theater campaign outcomes, which are categorized by "successful", "failed" and "canceled" based on launch date.

Based on this line chart, we can confirm that during the month of May and June, there was a highest count of successful outcomes in the theater category. These months are also the time where the most fundraisers has been created. We can conclude from the chart that starting a campaign on December would not have the best chance of achieving the fundraising goal. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In the analysis of outcomes based on launch date, I did not encounter any problems when creating the pivot table and line chart. A possible challenge a person can face when attempting to create the pivot table is not entering the pivot chart fields to the correct categories which are, "filters", "column", "rows", and "values". When creating the pivot chart, one should be aware entering the Date Created Conversion into the rows chart. One should filter out the excess information automatically added to the rows when creating the pivot chart. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
